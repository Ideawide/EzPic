## Inspiration
This was part of the addon competition hosted by Challenge post. http://chrome.challengepost.com/
It took around 3 hours to develop this addon. 

## How it works
1. Install the addon to chrome via chrome store
2. Open a new tab and navigate to a URL. (or refresh current tab)
3. On the address bar type ez <tab> and navigate the links on the page from the address bar.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
* Everything other than the video and the images were created within 3 hours

## What's next for EzPick
* All tabs link search
* Content search and focus
* Address bar lunches
